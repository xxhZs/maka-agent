/**
 * Settings row track contract.
 *
 * `.settingsRow` splits label and control across two grid tracks, and the
 * rule is one sentence: THE LABEL IS THE CONTENT, the right column is the
 * accessory. So the right track is sized to what it holds, capped so it
 * cannot starve the label, and the label takes everything else.
 *
 * The default used to be `minmax(150px, 0.36fr) minmax(0, 1fr)` — the
 * accessory got 1fr and the content was rationed to 0.36fr. #1524 noticed
 * the symptom but fixed it per control bucket, adding `minmax(0, 1fr) auto`
 * for switches and the compact time field while leaving the backwards
 * default in place "for rows whose control fills the value column".
 *
 * No such row exists. Every right column in the app is a switch, a ~94px
 * time field, a select capped at min(320px, 45%), or — 28 rows across the
 * 数据 / 开放网关 / 通用 / 关于 pages, via SettingRow — a short read-only
 * string. So the enumerated exceptions were the rule, and the default was
 * a defect that the contract was holding in place: on a ~1076px row the
 * value used ~64px of a ~791px track while the label was pinned to ~285px
 * and wrapped its hint to four lines, mid-word, because Chinese has no
 * spaces to break at.
 *
 * Stating it as the default is the point — it is what makes the next row
 * someone adds come out right without being enumerated here first.
 *
 * The cap is load-bearing in both directions, which is why the numbers are
 * pinned below:
 *   - bare `auto` sizes to max-content, and the 数据 page's workspace path
 *     is a ~690px unbroken string; that starves the label exactly the way
 *     0.36fr did, just from the other side.
 *   - a select's `w-full` trigger collapses under an intrinsic track
 *     (measured 320px → 118px), and a flat 320px cap eats the label
 *     instead (82px at a 468px card, just above the 460px stacking
 *     breakpoint). Only the both-caps form survives every width.
